Because Infernal is build as a cross platform game engine, it is imperative that it can detect on which platform it is running to change code on the fly. Infernal's platform detection can work out the basic systems Windows, Linux and Mac OS, others will not be supported because it is not currently planned to go mobile or in the web.

Even if the platform detector can't work with anything besides the big 3 for now, it is built in a way that it is easily expandable if needed in the future.
