Infernal needs UI like any other engine out there. We could have gone the ImGui route like many engines do, but this
poses some problems for us. Firstly we don't have any skills in ImGui, secondly this will only be nice for editors and
not really in games (in our opinion), and if we have to develop separate UI for games anyway we can just simply build a
system that fits both editors and game UI and is highly customizable and skinnable.

### Serialization

For the editor UI, you might need to save and load the UI layout and configuration. Implement a serialization mechanism
that allows you to save and load the UI state.
