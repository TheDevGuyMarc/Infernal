Infernal's Entry-point is an Application Class that every other Application that wants to use Infernal must implement. The entry-point holds also the main loop. For now this is single threaded but it is planned to multi-thread this.

In essence you just have to start the **run()** method from the derived application (Editor, Game, etc.), this will first init all systems and load assets. Next it will start the game loop, that will handle input, update game components and render the graphics. Lastly, if the loop is exited it will stop the application

For ease of use it is possible to configure the Application with a few parameters:
- Name
- Working Directory
- Rendering Engine:
	- ```openGL```
	- ```vulkan``` (?)
- Audio Engine
	- ```openAL```
	- ```fmod``` (?)
- Physics Engine
	- ```box2D```

For now it is only possible to choose the values in the Engine fields that are written above, but later it might be possible to choose other library implementations if they are supported. You might also choose to integrate your own third party library, which is possible with implementing the interfaces from the renderer, audio and physics engines.
