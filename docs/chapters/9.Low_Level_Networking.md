Because we want to enable developers to easily create multiplayer games as well we have built a low level networking library in Infernal as well.
This provides interfaces and classes for clients, servers, sharding, realms, players and authentication.

## Server Side Code
Infernal provides classes for authentication and game servers, but you can easily create other servers as well if you want. Every game server can host a limit of 10 realms. Realms are virtual server shards. Every realm consists at least of one realm shard, that in turn can hold 1000 players. If the player limit is hit, a new realm shard is created and opens another 1000 slots for players at the realm. Only players on the same realm and same realm shard can play with each other. This type of scaling allows us to fine grain the scaling for every use case, you can scale the servers, the realms and the realm shards, so we got the most flexibility.

We also implemented a server manager that can be implemented by game developers to create an external tool for controlling the servers.

## Client Side Code
Besides the server side code Infernal also provides code for clients, in core the game is a client and needs to implement the GameClient class. The client holds all needed logic for game clients so you can basically can chill out networking work.

## Usage of the library
In core this is a part of Infernal that shouldn't directly be used. This is mainly used in the multiplayer module of Infernal, but of course if needed you can choose to use some of this code.
