In Infernal we build games with an scene first approach. That means every game consists of multiple scenes that can in turn consist of multiple objects, levels and many more stuff. Developers can switch and choose between the scenes with help of the scene manager. Each scene in turn has it's own scene graph view that shows the developer what objects and other entities it holds.
