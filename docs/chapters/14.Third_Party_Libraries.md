Because Infernal uses some third party libraries, this affects how they are used as well. The current tech stack might
change, or we might switch all the technology completely in the future if certain changes are needed because a library
can't keep up, or we want to try something new.

This is why Infernal splits the code for the biggest third party libraries into API code and platform specific
implementations. That allows us to change the library and the specific implementation but never have to change engine
internal code and processes.

Infernal implements APIs for the following third party libraries:

- **OpenGL**
- **OpenAL**
- **Box2D**

How the architecture is implemented concretely you can see in the following chapters for the specific library.
