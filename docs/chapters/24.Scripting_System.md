In Infernal we implemented a Scripting System, that allows players to write game code in a simpler language than Java if they want. For now we only support Lua, but might add Javascript/Typescript in the future if the interpreter situation with Node, Deno and Bun is somewhat more finalized. 

The biggest challenge in scripting systems is, that you have to somewhat have an interpreter and a good API for developers to use but that can be understand by the interpreter. So it is quite hard to find the sweet spot of building a good API with the right amount of control for developers without over complicating stuff.
