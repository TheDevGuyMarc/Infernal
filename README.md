# Infernal Engine

Infernal Engine is a custom build 2D game engine written in Java with LWJGL. The purpose was a PoC but also to try learning what a game engine looks like under the hood. Also there was always the dream to create games but with the own custom engine and technology stack for better understanding what is going on.
